# Spacing utility CSS

Digital HIG utility CSS provides a collection of spacing classes based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Note: Requires utility CSS to be present in the document. See [the CSS overview page](?path=/docs/iccc-css-and-sass-css-overview--page) for more details.

## Digital HIG ready

The spacing classes are customized to match the specification of Digital HIG, so refer to the [spacing primitives page](/docs/iccc-theme-data-primitives-spacing--page) to consult the available spacing options.

## How to use Tailwind CSS

Spacing utility classes are generated with a `dhig-` prefix. Please use the Tailwind documentation and adjust classnames accordingly. For example:

For example, in Tailwind docs:

`p-0` padding: 0px;

Becomes:

```html
<div class="dhig-p-0">This div will have no padding</div>
```

Please note: The scale of the Tailwind configuration and Digital HIG is slighty different:

```
// Tailwind
p-1	padding: 0.25rem; // Resolves to 4px
p-2	padding: 0.5rem;  // Resolves to 8px
p-3	padding: 0.75rem; // Resolves to 12px
p-4	padding: 1rem;    // Resolves to 16px
p-5	padding: 1.25rem; // Resolves to 20px
p-6	padding: 1.5rem;  // Resolves to 24px
p-7	padding: 1.75rem; // Resolves to 28px
p-8	padding: 2rem;    // Resolves to 32px
p-9	padding: 2.25rem; // Resolves to 36px
```

```
// Digital HIG implementation
.dhig-p-1 // Resolves to 4px
.dhig-p-2 // Resolves to 8px
.dhig-p-3 // Resolves to 12px
.dhig-p-4 // Resolves to 16px
.dhig-p-5 // Resolves to 20px
.dhig-p-6 // Resolves to 24px
.dhig-p-7 // Resolves to 32px <-- Does not match
.dhig-p-8 // Resolves to 48px <-- Does not match
.dhig-p-9 // Resolves to 64px <-- Does not match
```

All values assume a root font size of 16 pixels.
