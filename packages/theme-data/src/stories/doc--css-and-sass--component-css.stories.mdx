# Component CSS overview

Digital HIG component CSS provides a collection of component classes. The styles are made up of preset assemblies of utility classes as well as additional rules, meaning that both the utility CSS and component CSS files need to be present in the document. See [the CSS overview page](?path=/docs/iccc-css-and-sass-css-overview--page) for more details.
