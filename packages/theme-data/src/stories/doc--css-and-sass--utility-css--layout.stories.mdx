# Layout utility CSS

Digital HIG utility CSS provides a collection of layout classes based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Note: Requires utility CSS to be present in the document. See [the CSS overview page](?path=/docs/iccc-css-and-sass-css-overview--page) for more details.

## Digital HIG ready

The layout classes are customized to match the specification of Digital HIG, so refer to the [spacing primitives page](/docs/iccc-theme-data-primitives-spacing--page) to consult the available spacing options.

## How to use Tailwind CSS

Spacing utility classes are generated with a `dhig-` prefix. Please use the Tailwind documentation and adjust classnames accordingly. For example:

For example, in Tailwind docs:

`fixed` position: fixed;

Becomes:

```html
<div class="dhig-fixed">This div will have fixed positioning</div>
```

Please note: The scale of the Tailwind configuration and Digital HIG is slighty different:

```
// Tailwind
inset-1	--> 0.25rem; // Resolves to 4px
inset-2	--> 0.5rem;  // Resolves to 8px
inset-3	--> 0.75rem; // Resolves to 12px
inset-4	--> 1rem;    // Resolves to 16px
inset-5	--> 1.25rem; // Resolves to 20px
inset-6	--> 1.5rem;  // Resolves to 24px
inset-7	--> 1.75rem; // Resolves to 28px
inset-8	--> 2rem;    // Resolves to 32px
inset-9	--> 2.25rem; // Resolves to 36px
```

```
// Digital HIG implementation
.dhig-inset-1 // Resolves to 4px
.dhig-inset-2 // Resolves to 8px
.dhig-inset-3 // Resolves to 12px
.dhig-inset-4 // Resolves to 16px
.dhig-inset-5 // Resolves to 20px
.dhig-inset-6 // Resolves to 24px
.dhig-inset-7 // Resolves to 32px <-- Does not match
.dhig-inset-8 // Resolves to 48px <-- Does not match
.dhig-inset-9 // Resolves to 64px <-- Does not match
```

All values assume a root font size of 16 pixels.
