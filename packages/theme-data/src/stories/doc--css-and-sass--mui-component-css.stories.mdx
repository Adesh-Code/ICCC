### How to extract React component templates for HTML/CSS usage

The examples below are provided for quick reference, but this is not an exhaustive list of all the possible component variations that can be rendered built using the React API. Here are the main steps needed to extract HTML for any component:

1. Go to the component Storybook page, making sure you are in the "Canvas" view, e.g. [button](/story/components-button--default-button).
1. Select the appropriate combination of props that you need using the "Controls" tab.
1. Click on the "HTML" tab and copy the contents.
1. Now you have the component template in your clipboard. Please keep in mind that some minor syntactical adjustments may be required. For example, some class names may have a dashed numeric suffix that may need to be stripped.
