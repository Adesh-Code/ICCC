Digital HIG theme data makes the Digital HIG style definitions available in `key:value` pairs, and is the core implementation of the design system. Digital HIG currently has 2 theme data sets, `lightTheme` and `darkTheme`.

## Using with Digital HIG components

No work required! Digital HIG theme data is already integrated into the ThemeMui wrapper.

## Using the values directly

Primitives are the root style values for the Digital HIG. Tokens are named based on how they should be used, and map to primitives. We recommend using token values, unless a value you need is not available as a token.

For front-end work that does not have a Digital HIG component implementation, you'll need to use the theme data directly. Follow the steps below for implementation.

### Installing Digital HIG theme data

To add Digital HIG theme data to your project:

```js
yarn add @iccc/theme-data
```

## Theme data formats

Theme data is available in several formats. You can choose which format you need depending on the type of project in which you are implementing design tokens.

### JSON

Design tokens

```js
import lightTheme from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/json/light/design-tokens.json";
import darkTheme from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/json/dark/design-tokens.json";
```

Component tokens

```js
import lightComponentTokens from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/json/light/component-tokens.json";
import darkComponentTokens from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/json/dark/component-tokens.json";
```

### SCSS variables

Design tokens in a flat SCSS variable format.

```js
@import "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/scss/variables/light/design-tokens.scss";
@import "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/scss/variables/dark/design-tokens.scss";
```

This file includes design tokens in a SCSS maps format.

```js
@import "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/scss/variables/_dhig_maps.scss";
```

### SCSS mixins

This file includes SCSS mixins that implement Digital HIG patterns:

```js
@import "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/scss/mixins/_dhig_mixins.scss";
```

### LESS variables

Design tokens in LESS format.

```js
import lightTheme from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/less/light/design-tokens.less";
import darkTheme from "@iccc/theme-data/lib/build/less/dark/design-tokens.less";
```
