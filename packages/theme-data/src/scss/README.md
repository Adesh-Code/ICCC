# SCSS

Include all mixins and maps here, using `dhig-` as a namespace. These are compiled from static files as part of the build process and output with the theme scss in `/lib/build/`.

These can be imported by teams to use in their code. We are also integrating these into our own outputted CSS in the /css dir.

## Primitives

The `_primitives.scss` files can include mixins and maps related to primitives.

## Components

For each component, create a map or mixin file named after that component.
